	<section class="intro"> <h2><u>Lesiba</u></h2><p>
The lesiba is regarded as Lesotho’s national musical instrument, often referred to as the "herd boy’s gramophone." It is a stringed-wind instrument made from a flattened quill attached to a sinew string stretched over a piece of hardwood. The player creates sound by blowing into the quill, causing the string to vibrate against the wood. This instrument is known for its emotive sound and is often described as personal, as players adjust it to suit their vocal styles.</p><img src="lesiba.jpeg" alt="Centered Image" class="custom-img"></section>
